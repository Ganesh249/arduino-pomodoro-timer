Arduino Pomodoro Timer

This Arduino program is designed to manage a Pomodoro-style timer with study sessions, short breaks, and a long break. It uses an LCD, an LED, and a buzzer to provide visual and auditory feedback.

Include Libraries

The Wire.h library is used for I2C communication, and the LiquidCrystal_I2C.h library controls the LCD.

Global Variables and Constants

LCD: Initializes the LCD with the I2C address 0x27 and a 16x2 display.
Time Variables: minutes and seconds are used to track time.
Constants: studytime, breaktime, longbreak, and repeat define the durations and repetitions.
Pins: buzzer, switch, gled, and bled are defined for the buzzer, button, green LED, and blue LED, respectively.

Setup Function

LCD Initialization: lcd.init() and lcd.begin(16, 2) initialize the LCD, and lcd.backlight() turns on the backlight.

Pin Modes: Sets the buzzer, green and blue LED as an output, and the switch as an input with an internal pull-up resistor.


Main Loop
Idle State: The blue LED (bled) is on, and the LCD prompts the user to press the button.
Button Press: When the button is pressed (switchval == LOW), the LCD is cleared, a tone is played, and the blue LED blinks (bledblnk()).
Pomodoro Cycle: The repeat loop runs the study sessions and short breaks. After repeat study sessions and short breaks, a long break is initiated.
Auditory Feedback: finaltone() plays a series of tones at the end of each session.

Tone Functions
tone(): Plays a single short tone.
finaltone(): Plays a sequence of 8 short tones, with the blue LED blinking in sync.

Study, Break, and Long Break Functions
These functions manage the display and timing for the study session, short and long breaks.
“studytimefun()”:
Setup: Turns on the green LED (gled), clears the LCD, and displays "Study Time!".
Timing Loop: Counts minutes and seconds, updating the LCD each second.
Completion: Turns off the green LED.

“breaktimefun() and longbreakfun()”:
These functions are similar to studytimefun(), with different durations and display messages.


Blue LED Blink Function
bledblnk(): Blinks the blue LED 5 times, then waits for 1 second.

Summary
Initialization: Sets up the LCD, LEDs, buzzer, and button.
Idle State: Displays a prompt to press the button.
Button Press: Initiates the Pomodoro cycle with study sessions, breaks, and a long break.
Timing Functions: Use nested loops to count time and update the display.
Feedback: Provides visual and auditory feedback using LEDs and the buzzer.
This program effectively manages study sessions and breaks with clear visual and auditory cues, providing a structured and interactive timing mechanism.

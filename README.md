Project Purpose:
This Arduino project is designed to implement a Pomodoro-style timer to help users manage their study sessions and breaks efficiently. The Pomodoro Technique involves working for a set period (usually 25 minutes), followed by a short break (5 minutes), and after several cycles, taking a longer break (15 minutes). This project uses an LCD, LEDs, and a buzzer to provide visual and auditory feedback to the user.

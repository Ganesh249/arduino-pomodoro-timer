Project Purpose:
This Arduino project is designed to implement a Pomodoro-style timer to help users manage their study sessions and breaks efficiently. The Pomodoro Technique involves working for a set period (usually 25 minutes), followed by a short break (5 minutes), and after several cycles, taking a longer break (15 minutes). This project uses an LCD, LEDs, and a buzzer to provide visual and auditory feedback to the user.

Key Components
LCD Display: A 16x2 I2C LCD messages and the countdown timer.
LEDs: Green and blue LEDs are used to indicate different states:
Green LED: Indicates active study or break periods.
Blue LED: Indicates idle state and blinks during transition periods.
Buzzer: Provides auditory feedback at the start and end of sessions and breaks.
Button: A push button is used to start the timer cycle.
